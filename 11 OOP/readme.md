# Object Oriented Programming

- In javascript there was not classes and if we see technically then it's not in today also.
- JavaScript is a prototype based language. Not object oriented or functional etc. It's classes are just syntactic sugar. Behind the scenes it uses prototype based inheritance mechanism.

## Object
- It's a collection of properties and methods.

## Why use OOP?
- To remove messed up code problem, it was created.

## Parts of OOP?
- Object literal
- constructor function
    - It allows you to create multiple instances from one object.
    - `new` keyword helps in creating new context. it's called constructor function.
- prototype
- classes
- Instances (new and this)

## 4 keywords
1. Abstraction: Hiding details
2. Encapsulation: Wrapping up data
3. Inheritance: Inherit properties from parent.
4. Polymorphism: One method can do many things.
