// Events

// In JS, events are run sequentially.
// But sometimes (in Async) it can run not in sequence.
// In browser events also an exception for this. They invoke on some activities.

// writing events in HTML such as onclick="alert('Hello')"; is not feasible approach. 
// It will create problems as your application grows.
